# 1. Background

## 1.1 Background Description

This project aims to create a web-based file-sharing platform that eliminates the constraints of time and location, making it a convenient and efficient solution for users. The target audience for this product is the general public, positioning it as a consumer-facing ("To C") offering.

The main objective is to develop a user-friendly platform that enables anyone to send and receive files quickly and effortlessly, regardless of their physical location or whether they are online simultaneously. This idea stems from the personal need for a more efficient and convenient file exchange method, which is believed to be a common requirement for many individuals.

The website will serve as a centralized hub for file exchange, connecting people with file transfer needs and empowering them to break free from traditional limitations, thus achieving efficient and seamless file sharing.

## 1.2 Benefits Analysis

While the project's essence lies in enhancing file-sharing efficiency and convenience, it does not directly generate revenue. However, its value proposition lies in boosting revenue growth for other services.

For instance, individuals can efficiently complete work transactions, such as commissioned tasks, through this file-sharing platform, streamlining the entire process. Efficient file transfers can save significant time and effort for all involved parties, improving their work efficiency and, consequently, their income. Therefore, although the project itself does not directly produce profits, it can provide substantial indirect benefits to users and enhance their overall productivity.

## 1.3 Solution Overview

- **Nextjs:** A popular web framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications, known for its performance and ease of use.
- **Docker:** A containerization platform that packages software and its dependencies into standardized containers, enabling consistent and scalable deployment.
- **File pool/Minio:** A distributed object storage system that provides a simple and robust solution for storing and managing files, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## 1.4 Feature Requirements

- **Upload and Download Flexibility:** Users should be able to upload files from their desktop or mobile devices and download files via shared links.
- **QR Code Generation:** Upon successful upload, a QR code should be generated on the webpage, facilitating easy file sharing between users.
- **File Size Limit:** Implement a maximum file size limit of 100MB to ensure efficient storage and transfer.
- **Archival Time:** Do not restrict file archival time unless the server is restarted, providing users with extended access to their uploaded files.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Ensure that the file upload and download processes are straightforward and intuitive, minimizing complexity for users.
- **Security and Privacy:** Guarantee the security and privacy of the file transfer process, protecting user data.
- **Support Various File Formats:** Accommodate a range of file types, including documents, images, and videos, to cater to diverse user needs.

## 1.5 Exception Handling

### 1.5.1 Expected Exception Handling

In typical scenarios, such as server restarts, basic exception handling capabilities are sufficient. We do not have high requirements for handling expected exceptions.

### 1.5.2 Unexpected Exception Handling

However, special cases like unexpected server power outages or hardware failures demand a more comprehensive handling mechanism. These unforeseen exceptions require a robust and resilient approach.

### 1.5.3 Exception Recovery

Consider strategies for recovering from exceptions, such as resuming ongoing file transfers after a server restart and preventing data loss or corruption.

### 1.5.4 Logging

Implement a well-designed logging mechanism to facilitate exception handling. Detailed logs enable tracking, analysis, and resolution of exceptions.

## 1.6 Role Permissions

The application defines two primary roles: users and administrators. As the administrator, you have the highest level of access and full control over the application and its features. In contrast, the user role refers to anonymous individuals accessing the platform.

**User Role Features:**

- **Anonymous Access:** Users can access and utilize the application without login or registration. They are treated as anonymous users by default.
- **Download via Links:** Users only need to possess the encrypted link to download files securely. This encryption enhances security by preventing unauthorized access.
- **Seamless Sharing:** Users can effortlessly share and download files without undergoing any authentication process, streamlining the file exchange.

**Administrator Role Features:**

The administrator role enjoys extended permissions and capabilities:

- **Admin Panel Access:** You have unrestricted access to the admin panel, allowing comprehensive management of the application's settings, features, and user roles.
- **Role Management:** Create and manage user roles, assign or revoke specific permissions, and control access levels.
- **Monitor and Control:** Monitor and manage file-sharing activities, including viewing, deleting, or disabling access to shared files.
- **Link Management:** Generate and manage encrypted links, set link expiration dates, control access, and ensure link security.
- **Customization:** Have complete control over the application's settings, appearance, and user experience, enabling customization to meet specific requirements.

Currently, the application prioritizes basic file-sharing functionality, with the development of the admin panel being postponed to focus on core features. As the application matures, the administrator role will be granted additional permissions and customization options to enhance the platform's capabilities further.

## 1.7 User Stories/Scenarios

### Scenario 1: File Sharing via Chat Room

1. User A intends to share files with you, but the chat room only supports sending pictures and a limited range of file types.
2. User A attempts to share the files by sending screenshots in the chat room, but the images are challenging to read and understand.
3. You provide User A with a web link (louislabs.com/upload) to upload files directly.
4. The webpage guides User A through selecting the files for upload and generates a unique link for sharing.
5. User A copies the link and pastes it into the chat room, sharing it with you.
6. You click on the link and effortlessly view and download the shared files, overcoming the limitations of the chat room platform.
