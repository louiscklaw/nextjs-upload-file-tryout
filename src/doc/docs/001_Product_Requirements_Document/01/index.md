## 1.1 Background Description

A web-based file-sharing project, this is a convenient file transfer solution designed to eliminate time and location constraints on file sharing. The target users of this product are the general public, making it a "To C" product.

The goal is to create a simple and user-friendly platform that enables anyone to send and receive files quickly and effortlessly, regardless of whether they are in the same place at the same time. The motivation behind this idea stems from your own need for a more efficient and convenient way to exchange files, which you believe is a shared need for many people.

The webpage will serve as a centralized file exchange hub, connecting individuals with file transfer needs and enabling them to break free from traditional constraints, achieving efficient file sharing.

## 1.2 Benefits Analysis

The essence of this project lies in enhancing the efficiency and convenience of file sharing, and it does not directly generate revenue by itself.

However, its value lies in boosting revenue growth for other services.

For example, when individuals can efficiently complete work transactions (such as commission tasks) through this file-sharing platform, the entire process becomes smoother. Efficient file transfer can save a lot of time and effort for the parties involved, thus improving their work efficiency and income. Therefore, although the project itself does not directly generate profits, it can bring significant indirect benefits to all parties involved and improve their overall work efficiency.

## 1.3 Solution Overview

- nextjs (web/backend framework)
- docker (container framework)
- file pool/minio (file storage)

## 1.4 Feature Requirements

- Allow users to upload files via desktop or mobile devices or download files via shared links.
- Generate a QR code on the webpage for easy file sharing between users after a successful upload.
- Limit file size to within 100MB.
- Do not restrict the file archival time unless the server is restarted.
- Ensure that the process of uploading and downloading files is straightforward and user-friendly.
- Guarantee the security and privacy of the file transfer process.
- Support various file formats such as documents, images, and videos.

## 1.5 Exception Handling

### 1.5.1 Expected Exception Handling

In general cases, we can foresee certain exceptions, such as server restarts. For these expected exceptions, we do not have high requirements and only need basic exception handling capabilities.

### 1.5.2 Unexpected Exception Handling

However, in some special cases, there may be some unforeseen exceptions, such as unexpected server power outages, hardware failures, etc. These exceptions require a more comprehensive handling mechanism.

### 1.5.3 Exception Recovery

In addition to handling exceptions, we also need to consider how to recover from them. For example, how to recover ongoing file transfers after a server restart? How to prevent data loss or corruption?

### 1.5.4 Logging

Moreover, a well-designed logging mechanism is crucial for exception handling. Detailed logs can help track and analyze the causes of exceptions and formulate corresponding solutions.

## 1.6 Role Permissions

Currently, the application only defines two roles: users and administrators. The administrator is you, with the highest level of access and full control over the application and its features. On the other hand, the user role refers to anonymous users accessing the application.

**User Role Features**

- Users can access the application without login or registration. They are considered anonymous users by default.
- Users only need to have the link to download files. These links are encrypted to ensure that other users cannot guess or infer the link, enhancing security.
- Users can easily share and download files without any authentication process.

**Administrator Role Features**

The administrator role (your role) has more permissions and capabilities:

- You have full access to the admin panel (yet to be built). In this panel, you can manage all aspects of the application.
- Create and manage user roles, assign or revoke specific permissions.
- Monitor and manage file-sharing activities. You can view all shared files and also delete or disable access to specific files.
- Manage links: You can generate and manage encrypted links, including setting link expiration dates, controlling access, and ensuring link security.
- Have complete control over application settings, appearance, and user experience.

Currently, the application focuses on basic file-sharing functionality. The development of the admin panel will be postponed to concentrate on core features. However, as the application evolves, the administrator role will be granted more permissions and customization options.

## 1.7 User Stories/Scenarios

### Scenario 1

1. User A wants to share some files with me, but the chat room only allows sending pictures and other limited file types.
2. User A tries to share files by sending screenshots in the chat room, but I find these images difficult to read and understand.
3. I provide User A with a web link (louislabs.com/upload), through which User A can upload files.
4. The webpage allows User A to select the files to be uploaded and generates a unique link.
5. User A copies the link and pastes it into the Carousell chat room to share it with me.
6. I click on the link and can easily view and download the shared files.
