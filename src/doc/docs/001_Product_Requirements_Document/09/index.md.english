## Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) Objectives

The SMART principle (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound) is designed to help employees work more efficiently and effectively. It also provides managers with clear performance evaluation goals and standards, ensuring that assessments are scientific, standardized, fair, open, and equitable.

### Project Acceptance and Success Criteria

For B2B products, it can be challenging to directly measure business value and returns. In such cases, consider evaluating:

- Functionality usage
- Customer satisfaction

B2B products cater to enterprise users, helping them manage day-to-day business activities such as inventory management, sales statistics, and employee attendance tracking. Essentially, any product that addresses enterprise needs can be categorized as a B2B product.
